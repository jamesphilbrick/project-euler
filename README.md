# project-euler

## Overview
A personal archive of solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problem set. Most problems require both mathematical insight and efficient programming techniques to solve. 
> "Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."

## Goals 📝
I have two long term goals I'd like to acheive:
* To increase my mathematical toolset and understanding
* and to improve my programming skills by writing efficient code. 

My short term goals are to:
* Fully solve the first 50 problems
* and write at least half of these problems in more than one language (ideally something low-level like Go).

## Progress ✔️
The badge above shows my level and number of problems solved and [this table](./table.md) shows which of the first 50 problems I have successfully completed, as well as which language(s) I used. If you wish to add me as a friend on the site, my key is ```1744377_mokENmhw1IDIoJ8AE2a5gUXZwDySYYrS```.

## Disclaimer ❗
Note that I will not be publishing any problems beyond no. 100 as this is against the mindset of active learning and terms of use. It may even see my account banned
and it's not a risk I'm willing to take. 
> However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any 
> discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. 
> Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for 
> those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere.
